# Existence

**Your life, visualized in real-time.**

A meditative, awe-inspiring visualization of your existence. Enter your birthdate and watch your life unfold in seconds, heartbeats, breaths, and weeks.

## Features

- **Real-time seconds counter** - Watch your life tick by, second by second
- **Body statistics** - Estimated heartbeats, breaths, and blinks since birth
- **Cosmic events** - Sunrises witnessed, full moons seen, seasons experienced
- **Life grid** - Your entire life in weeks, visualized. Green = lived. Purple = now. Gray = future.
- **Life progress** - See how much of your average lifespan you've experienced

## Philosophy

This isn't meant to be morbid. It's meant to be *meditative*. Every second you see ticking is a second you're alive. Every heartbeat counted is your heart doing its job. The life grid doesn't show what you've lost — it shows what you've *lived*.

> "In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years."
